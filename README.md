# JobBoard
Just a little project to practice some front end and use AI.

A list of jobs and a form to add a new one.

On the form, you can paste in a job description and your open api key (not safe, I know) and it will parse it into the correct type and add it to the list of jobs.
Go back to the job list to see it.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
